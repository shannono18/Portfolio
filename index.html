                <div class="half-width">
                    <p>I've spent most of my career helping employers understand and maximinze use of SaaS platforms, in support of their overall well-being and healthcare strategies. After joining a high growth start-up, I developed a stronger interest in tech, and the user experience in particular. I took some free html and css courses online and I was hooked! When I learned how to build my first
                        website, I knew I'd found something that would allow me to bring my passion for improving the lives of others, a strong skillset and experience, to create something special for my customers. In October 2021, I'll have completed a full-stack development bootcamp through UC Irvine. I'm excited to make a full switch to front-end development, and build upon my work experience in Customer Success, project management, cross-functional team work, problem solving, and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.</p>

                    <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
                    <p>My focus is writing clean, well formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content
                        is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

                    <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean
                        and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>
